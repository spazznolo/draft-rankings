Instructions on the scripts-for-interview folder:

I recommend you view the scripts in the order in which they are run, which is the following:
    - libraries.R: load necessary libraries.
    - functions.R: load necessary functions.
    - data.R: load necessary data.
    - get_weights.R: load time weights.
    - frequentist.R: implement frequentist Plackett-Luce model.
    
This gets us the prospect pick probability estimates we use for the analysis.

These estimates feed into the following four scripts, the first two are for entertainment, the last two are for decision making:
  - head_to_head.R: compute probability a given prospect is picked ahead of another prospect.
  - live_probabilities.R: compute probability of prospects being selected with the next pick.
  - derive_pick_values.R: derive pick values from prospect values and pick probabilities.
  - decision_making.R: use pick values to create decision making framework.

I've written about this work in four blog posts, which can be found here:
