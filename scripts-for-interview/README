The goal of this project was to derive prospect pick probabilities from expert rankings. These probabilities offer various use cases:
	- get live probabilities after each pick (entertainment)
	- compare prospect pick probabilities head to head (entertainment)
	- derive pick values of given draft, instead of using historical averages (business)
	- create decision-making framework (business)
	
Instructions on the scripts-for-interview folder:

I recommend you view the scripts in the order in which they are run, which is the following:
    - libraries.R: load necessary libraries.
    - functions.R: load necessary functions.
    - data.R: load necessary data.
      	- format ranking set
	      - create skater dictionary
	      - create ranking dictionary
	      - reshape ranking set into partial rankings matrix
	      - create full rankings via imputation, weighted by appearance counts
    - get_weights.R: load time weights.

This gets us the input data for the Placket-Luce model.

These data are then modelled in the following script:
    - frequentist.R: implement frequentist Plackett-Luce model.
    
This gets us the prospect pick probability estimates used for the analysis.

These estimates feed into the following four scripts:
  - head_to_head.R: compute probability a given prospect is picked ahead of another prospect.
  - live_probabilities.R: compute probability of prospects being selected with the next pick.
  - derive_pick_values.R: derive pick values from prospect values and pick probabilities.
  - decision_making.R: use pick values to create decision making framework.

I've written about this work in four blog posts, which can be found here:
