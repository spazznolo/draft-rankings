Instructions on the scripts-for-interview folder:

I recommend you view the scripts in the order in which they are run, which is the following:
    - libraries.R
    - functions.R
    - data.R
    - get_weights.R
    - frequentist.R
    
This gets us the prospect pick probability estimates we use for the analysis.

These estimates feed into the following four scripts, the first two are for entertainment, the last two are for teams:
  - head_to_head.R: 
  - live_probabilities.R:
  - derive_pick_values.R
  - decision_making.R
